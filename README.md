# stakepool_python_tools
some tools written in python to run cardano staking pools

As a starter an alternative to topologyUpdater.sh is provided. It does not have the full functionality, but will be improved over time. However, it does provide the main functionality by pushing node alive to the Topology Updater API and fetches a new topology file.

Don't use the JSON configuration file yet. It will be integrated later. For the first release you'll have to edit parameters directly into the Python source file. There's no env configuration file needed - in opposition to the shell script.

Future updates will include sending emails for the purpose of monitoring the updates.

If you like the tools - then please support us and stake with ATAAT.
